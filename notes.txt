http://chan-link.sourceforge.net/


BUGS
----
- Box.execute_delayed() does not work properly (I think ?)
- flood control is nasty code because of the above bug
- flood control doesn't work anyway...
- remote commands .load and .reload do not work at all


TODO
----
- ability to reload config files w/o restart
- add command trigger 'list' to report the users in a remote 
  channel
- get flood control working properly
- support for connection protocols other than IRC!
- (later) GUI frontend for configuration



Coming Soon in v0.2
